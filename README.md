CumulusServer is a complete open source and cross-platform RTMFP server extensible by way of scripting.

CumulusServer has been developed under [GPL license] in keeping in mind the 4 following notions: *speed*, *light weight*, *cross-platform* and *scalable*.

Even though there is no versioning released yet, code pushed on github is done only when CumulusServer has been tested and approved.

Actually, the main stable features are:

- P2P rendez-vous service
- Live streaming
- RPC, pull, push exchanges, indeed all AMF possible exchanges between client and server
- Scripting engine to create your own application server or extends Cumulus features
- Scalability and load-balancing solution

All the documentation to get, install and use CumulusServer is available through the **[Wiki]**.

The community can talk about Cumulus on [openrtmfp-cumulus](http://groups.google.com/group/openrtmfp-cumulus) forum or report a bug on [issues](https://github.com/OpenRTMFP/Cumulus/issues) page.
